        <p>Godzilla (ゴジラ Gojira) is a Titan who first appeared in the 2014 Legendary Pictures film, Godzilla.
            <br>
            The MonsterVerse Godzilla is the second incarnation of Godzilla to be featured in an American-made film, after the TriStar Godzilla from the 1998 film, and the tenth onscreen incarnation of the character overall. A colossal apex predator hailing from a time in Earth's past where surface radiation levels were considerably higher, Godzilla retreated deep underwater as this radiation declined to feed on the planet's natural geothermal radiation. He occasionally surfaced throughout history, inspiring some of humanity's mythology. In the 20th century, the advent of the nuclear age drew Godzilla to the surface along with the deadly Shinomura, attracting the attention of the American military, which carried out a campaign of nuclear strikes against the two clashing monsters in the South Pacific under the guise of nuclear testing. While Shinomura was vaporized by the blast of the Castle Bravo hydrogen bomb, Godzilla survived and vanished up until 2014 when parasitic creatures from his time period dubbed MUTOs were unleashed and prepared to begin reproducing. Godzilla hunted the MUTOs down to San Francisco, where he engaged in a protracted battle that ended when he killed them both and returned to the ocean. After subsequently slaying the MUTOs' mother, MUTO Prime, Godzilla disappeared into the depths of the ocean for five years, though Monarch kept tabs on him.
            <br>
            When a group of eco-terrorists awakened his ancient nemesis King Ghidorah from his icy tomb in Antarctica, Godzilla confronted the newly-awakened three-headed Titan. King Ghidorah escaped their first battle, but Godzilla tracked him down to the waters off of Mexico and nearly defeated him in an underwater clash before being interrupted by the military's Oxygen Destroyer. Godzilla retreated to his underwater lair to heal, but his rejuvenation was accelerated by the sacrifice of Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, who set off a thermonuclear warhead in his vicinity. Godzilla made his way to Boston for a final battle with Ghidorah, and with the intervention of Mothra was finally able to triumph. The surviving Titans who had been following Ghidorah congregated around Godzilla and submitted to him, accepting him as the King of the Monsters. In the time after Ghidorah's defeat, Godzilla worked to maintain balance among the newly-awakened Titans. He fought Scylla when she battled the U.S. Coast Guard over a nuclear warhead, drove Amhuluk from Behemoth's territory, rescued Na Kika from being captured by humans, and battled Tiamat before finding a new lair in the Hollow Earth. Before he himself could rest again, Godzilla set out to return the other Titans to their ancient rest.
            <br>
            Five years later, Godzilla sensed Apex Cybernetics' construction of Mechagodzilla, an artificial Titan meant to overthrow him, and began attacking the company's facilities, with humanity assuming he had turned against them. When Godzilla intercepted a U.S. fleet transporting Kong, the battle was broken up by depth charges and Godzilla left the scene after the remains of the fleet "played dead" by shutting down their power and he no longer deemed Kong a threat. Godzilla headed to Hong Kong after he sensed Mechagodzilla being activated and drilled a hole into the Hollow Earth with his atomic breath, allowing Kong to intercept him. After a brutal battle, Godzilla defeated Kong before battling Mechagodzilla but was soon overwhelmed. The combined might of Godzilla and Kong, as well as some human interference, managed to defeat Mechagodzilla. Godzilla subsequently acknowledged Kong and returned to the ocean.
